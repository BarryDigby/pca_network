Introns are spliced out of RNA transcripts as lariat structures, and then are typically debranched and rapidly degraded. Here, we describe an unusual spliced intron from the constant region of the T cell receptor-β (TCR-β) locus that is relatively stable in mammalian cells. This intron, IVS1 cβ1 , accumulates as a set of lariat RNA structures with different length talls in the nucleus of T cells. The accumulation of this spliced intron is developmentally regulated during murine thymocyte ontogeny. The property of stability appears to be evolutionary conserved since the human version of this intron also accumulates in T cells. The stability is selective since other spliced TCR-β introns do not detectably accumulate in T cells. The unusual stability of this intron does not depend on T cell specific factors since non-T cells transfected with TCR-β gene constructs also accumulate spliced IVSI cβ1 . The discovery of a mammalian intron that accumulates as a lariat in vivo provides an opportunity to elucidate mechanisms that regulate intron debranching, stability, and nuclear localization. }",

Moreover, androgen and its cognate receptor, androgen receptor (AR), regulate various signaling pathways for prostate tumor growth. In addition, progression to lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is also owing to AR function. Systematic analysis of AR-binding sites and their regulated transcripts revealed that many ncRNAs are widely regulated at the transcriptional level. Thus, recent studies provide new insight into the complicated molecular mechanism of prostate cancer progression.

Mammals have thousands of circRNAs with predicted miRNA binding sites, but only two circRNAs have been verified as being actual miRNA sponges. As it is unclear whether these thousands of predicted miRNA binding sites are functional, we investigated whether miRNA seed sites within human circRNAs are under selective pressure.Results: Using SNP data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we found a significant decrease in SNP density at miRNA seed sites compared with flanking sequences and random sites. This decrease was similar to that of miRNA seed sites in 3' untranslated regions, suggesting that many of the predicted miRNA binding sites in circRNAs are functional and under similar selective pressure as miRNA binding sites in mRNAs.Contact:pal.satrom@ntnu.noSupplementary information:Supplementary Data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

abstract = {Summary
Recent studies have reported that competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) can act as sponges for a microRNA (miRNA) through their binding sites and that changes in ceRNA abundances from individual genes can modulate the activity of miRNAs. Consideration of this hypothesis would benefit from knowing the quantitative relationship between a miRNA and its endogenous target sites. Here, we altered intracellular target site abundance through expression of an miR-122 target in hepatocytes and livers and analyzed the effects on miR-122 target genes. Target repression was released in a threshold-like manner at high target site abundance (≥1.5 × 105 added target sites per cell), and this threshold was insensitive to the effective levels of the miRNA. Furthermore, in response to extreme metabolic liver disease models, global target site abundance of hepatocytes did not change sufficiently to affect miRNA-mediated repression. Thus, modulation of miRNA target abundance is unlikely to cause significant effects on gene expression and metabolism through a ceRNA effect.}
